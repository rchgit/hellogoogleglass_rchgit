Realized I was over complicating things with sharedpreferences. 

Just instanciated the gps tracker to the custommapview class.

next step is for the map to update itself, when gps changes.

Looking at asynctask and/or runnable.


also, yay i finally (hopefully) learned how to use github correctly!
