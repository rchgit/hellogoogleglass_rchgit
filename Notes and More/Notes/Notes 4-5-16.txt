Realized that I have to implement the location listener of android better.
Will research into new location getting techniques. I believe assisted GPS is enabled on phones by default.

Thought of something.
Data doesnt scan until QR check point has been scanned.
When QR checkpoint is scanned, locator on the map will snap to the location of the scanned QR code.
It is then that GPS data and magnetometer data are read.

Recent Revelations; why do i force myself to make dlsu straight when clearly its not straight on the map.

Will do a revision based on non edited version pulled from google maps.
