I think a role change is in order what with recent developments.
Lead programmer for IPS isn't doing job / doing a really terrible job. 
Will convene with co-leader regarding this. Considering... alternatives.

I have to write. I am frustrated that the lead developer for the IPS did not give as much output as I imagined.
From 1 - 100%, I consider the output he gives to be a measly 10%. It seems that he prioritizes everything else above this thesis.
I don't know but i am calm again.
Time to reassess the situation.
Next PRO2; consider changing objective based on what group will convene aboit.
